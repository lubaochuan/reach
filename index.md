### What is Reach?

Reach is a project designed to assist students enrolled in [SBU's](https://www.sbuniv.edu/) Applied Software Engineering courses. As software applications become more catered to Web and mobile to accommodate user needs, creating a business-level application becomes increasingly advanced, typically faster than academic instutions can integrate into their coursework. This creates an intense learning curve for those who have never created a business-level application, where concepts learned in the classroom are applied in a hybrid academic and industry setting.

The solution is Reach, a way to **bridge the gap between industry and academia** by providing resources on *how* to create a full-scale web or mobile application. Anyone can read documentation or books or watch videos, but if students are not told how and why different technologies work together, they may be overwhelmed.

### How does it work?

Reach is currently made up of web application development resources. The resources are designed to give students more context about the semantics of web development. Students will be able to find references to best practices, frequently used tools and technologies, and solutions to common problems.

### Who creates Reach content?

Reach was created and is actively mantained by [Cavanaugh Richards](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cavanaughrichards/). You can read more about him [here](./about).

### I have a question. Where do I ask it?

The best place for questions is to create a GitHub issue in the [Reach repository](https://github.com/cavatron/reach/issues). This helps with organizing and prioritizing which content needs to be added to the site next, as well as allowing for preliminary discussion about the topic in question.
