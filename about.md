> I created Reach so that I can share some of my web and mobile development knowledge with my classmates. I believe teaching others is one of the greatest ways to learn, and I find the opportunity to create this content exciting and fruitful for my own development. I desire for my writings here to illustrate my continuous journey of creating full stack web and mobile applications in order that readers will be relieved of some of the stress that comes inevitably with **bridging the gap**.
